/*
 * Explanation
 * -----------
 *
 * We want to compare the numeric differences of the two lists and sum them. After parsing the input file,
 * each list is repeatedly checked to get the next pair of smallest numbers via the `find_min_argpos` function.
 * In order to count each entry once, entries are replaced with the placeholder value `CHECKED_ID` after
 * being processed.
 *
 * Is this the best solution? Not at all.
 * The best (?) solution would be to simply sort both lists independently and then iterate over
 * each pair and summing the differences.
 *
 * The reason I came up with this much more convoluted method of solving this was because I was under the
 * impression the problem wanted to compare the *difference in position within the lists* of each pair.
